### A Local Home Page for OSX Web Development

This is a small and simple local home page that automatically lists, and provide links to, your local sites. It's pretty much a copy of [this repo](https://github.com/cmall/LocalHomePage.git) that is a companion project for his [blog post](http://mallinson.ca/post/osx-web-development) that I read about setting up your Mac for web development.
